# moska
A repo for simulating moska games, and trying different play algorithms.

This is designed for simulations of moska games with different algorithms, and playing as a human can be quite tedious.

## TODO LIST
- Create TESTS!!
- Clean moska.py, possibly add reading the configurations from file.
- Create a benchmarking system, that records each games initial order, final ranking. Then create an analyzing system.
- If benchmarking works, make it possible to run games without logging to increase speed.
- thread : player -mapping could probably be made global, and used to prevent accidental modification of moskaGame and other attributes
- Fix when running multiple games, the log files are appended if usig the same name
-
